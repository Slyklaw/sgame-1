1. Let's make a simple board game using a React Native framework like Expo. Name the game "Sabotage". Create the project in the current working directory using a blank template. Install a minimal set of dependencies.
Checked-in

2. Change the display of the player pieces from 'x' and 'o' to a blue circle and a red circle.

3. The initial state of the board should be empty.




The game is named "sabotage".
It should be playable on mobile devices and desktop browsers. Be sure to give instructions for initial project setup and to install any necessary dependencies.
It should look like a classic board game along the lines of checkers or chess. Give the squares a subtle checkerboard effect.
The board has 15 columns and 7 rows with square spaces.
Make sure the whole game is centered and fully visible on the screen without any scrolling.
We'll be adding pieces and rules later.
Use the modern commands npm/npx for cli tooling.
